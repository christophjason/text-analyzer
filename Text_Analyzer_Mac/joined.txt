GOOD AFTERNOON LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY NAME IS AMINU IBRAHIM HASHIM, I AM A FINAL YEAR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT FROM THE SCHOOL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF BIT. I AM ALSO A MEMBER OF THE BIT INTER CULTURAL EXCHANGE ASSOCIATION. AND ON BEHALF OF MY COLLEAGUES, I AM EXTREMELY PLEASED AND HONORED TO WELCOME YOU ALL INTO THIS WONDERFUL UNIVERSITY. I STAND BEFORE YOU TODAY TO SHARE MY EXPERIENCES ABOUT AN IMPORTANT PART OF YOUR STAY IN CHINA, AS REGARDS TO FOLLOWING CHINESE RULES AND REGULATIONS, AND THE PROCEDURES AND GUIDELINES FOR VISA APPLICATION.WHEN I WAS A NEW STUDENT IN BIT, I ENJOYED A LOT OF SUPPORT AND GUIDANCE DURING MY FIRST RESIDENCE PERMIT APPLICATION PROCESS, TEACHERS AND VOLUNTEERS GUIDED US THROUGH IT ALL, RIGHT FROM SETTING UP THE REQUIRED DOCUMENTS ALL THROUGH TO THE MEDICAL CHECK AND VERIFICATION. APPLICATION FOR THE RESIDENCE PERMIT WAS FAIRLY EASY, AS WE HAD THE  FULL SUPPORT OF BIT STAFF AND VOLUNTEERS.  TO PROCESS YOUR APPLICATION, ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS TAKE YOUR PASSPORT, JW201, ONE VISA SIZE PHOTO WITH A WHITE BACKGROUND, COPIES OF VALID TEMPORARY RESIDENCE, AND THE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION CERTIFICATE VERIFIED BY CHINA’S ENTRY-EXIT INSPECTION AND QUARANTINE BUREAU.SUBSEQUENT RESIDENCE PERMIT APPLICATIONS WERE EVEN MUCH EASIER. AS WHEN I DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO GO RENEW THE VISA MYSELF, I COLD SIMPLY PAY A LITTLE EXTRA MONEY TO HAVE AN AGENT FROM THE SCHOOL DO IT FOR ME AND HAVE MY PASSPORT DELIVERED RIGHT BACK TO THE DORMITORY.  AN IMPORTANT DETAIL OF NOTE IS TO NOT FORGET TO RENEW YOUR VISA 30 DAYS BEFORE THE DATE OF ITS EXPIRATION. AS A FINE OF 500RMB IS CHARGED PER DAY. THAT’S MONEY THAT COULD BE WELL SPENT IN TRAVELLING AROUND CHINA. ALSO REMEMBER TO ATTENTION TO YOUR PASSPORT AND VISA STATUS, AND MAKE SURE THEY ARE NOT EXPIRED. I REMEMBER DURING THE LAST SEMESTER, SOME STUDENTS WHERE STOPPED AND ASKED TO SHOW THEIR PASSPORT BY THE POLICE, AND BECAUSE THEY DIDN’T HAVE IDENTIFICATION ON THEM, THEY WERE TAKEN TO THE POLICE STATION AND WERE ONLY RELEASED LATER DURING THE DAY, SO TO AVOID PROBLEMS WHEN YOU GO OUT, REMEMBER TAKE COPIES OR PICTURES OF YOUR PASSPORT, VISA AND VALID TEMPORARY RESIDENCE; ALSO TAKE YOUR PASSPORT WITH YOU IF YOU ARE TRAVELING OUTSIDE BEIJING AS HOTELS WILL NOT ACCOMMODATE YOU IF YOU DO NOT HAVE IT IN YOUR POSSESSION.WITH MY VALID RESIDENCE PERMIT, I CAN ENTER AND EXIT CHINA FREELY (INCLUDING HONG KONG, MACAO AND TAIWAN). IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO APPLY FOR A NEW VISA WHILE HOLDING A VALID RESIDENCE PERMIT. WHICH MAKES IT EASIER TO TRAVEL.  YOU SHOULD HOWEVER REMEMBER TO NOTIFY THE OFFICE OF INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS BEFORE TRAVELLING OR LEAVING THE COUNTRY AS THEY CAN BE VERY HELPFUL INCASE YOU GET INTO ANY ISSUES. I WISH YOU ALL A PLEASANT STAY IN CHINA AND IN BIT. THANK YOU
